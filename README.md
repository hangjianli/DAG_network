# Structural learning of Gaussian Directed Acyclic Graphs from Network Data

The traditional directed acyclic graph (DAG) model assumes data are generated independently from the underlying joint distribution defined by the DAG. In many applications, however, individuals are linked via a network and thus the indepen- dence assumption does not hold. We propose a novel Gaussian DAG model for network data, where the dependence among individual data points (row covariance) is modeled by an undirected graph. Under this model, we develop a maximum penalized likelihood method to estimate the DAG structure and the row correlation matrix. The algorithm iterates between a decoupled lasso regression step and a graphical lasso step.
